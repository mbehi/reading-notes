# Click on the Link: [The Past, Present & Future of Local Storage for Web Applications](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)
## Diving In
- Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries.
- Cookies were invented early in the web's history, and indeed they can be used for presistent local storage of small amounts of data.
- But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:
  1. Cokies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over.
  2. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
  3. COokies are limited to about 4KB  of data -- enough to slow down applicaion (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful.
