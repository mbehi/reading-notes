   ## Chapter 10 Introducing CSS
    - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
    - Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the element the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
    - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
    - Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of front, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
    - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Ducket JS Book
   ## Chapter 2 Basic JavaScript Instructions
    - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
    - Scripts contain very precise instruction. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
    - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script/
    - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
    - JavaScript distinguished between number (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
    - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
    - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
