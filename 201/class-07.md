# Reading Domain Modeling
  ## Summary
   - Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for specific program.
   - And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
   - Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models
    1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
    2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initalizes properties.
    3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
    4. Create instances using the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
    5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
    6. Use the `this` variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
