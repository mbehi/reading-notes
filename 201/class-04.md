   ## Chapter 4 Links
    - Links are created used the <a> elements.
    - The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
    - If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
    - You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
    - You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

   ## Chapter 15 Layout
    - <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
    - Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
    - The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
    - Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
    - Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
    - Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
    - CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
    - You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

   ## Chapter 3 Functions, Methods, and Objects (first part pp 86 to 99)
     What is a Function?
      - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific tasks. 
      - If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statement).
     
     Declaring a Function
      - To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. 
      - This is known as a function declaration.

    Calling a Function
      - Having declared the function you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.
      - This is known as a called the function. 
   
    Declaring Functions that need information
      - Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task.
      - In such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters.
      - Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

    Calling Functions that need information
      - When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name.
      - The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or as variables.

    Getting Single Value Out of a Function
      - Some functions return information to the code that called them.
      - For example, when they perform a calculation, they return the result.
