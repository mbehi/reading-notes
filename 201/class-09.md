  ### How Forms Work
  - A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

  - Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a `<form>` element.
  - Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

  - HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
