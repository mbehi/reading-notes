# Duckett JS Book
   ## Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
    - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
    - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
    - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
    - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
    - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), string (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
    - Expressions evaulate into a single value.
    - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

   ## Chapter 4 Decisions and Loops (from switch statements on)
    - Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
    - All values evalulate to either truthy or falsy.
    - There are three types of loop
        1. For
        2. While
        3. Do...while
    - Each repeats a set of statements
