   ## Chapter 3 Object Literals
    What is an Object?
     - Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.
     - In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

    Creating an Object: Literal Notation
     - Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.
     - There are several ways to create objects.   

    Accessing an Object and Dot Notation
     - You access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation.
     - You can also access properties using square brackets.
   
    Creating Objects: Constructor Notation
     - The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object.
     - You can then add properties and methods to the object.

    Updating an Object
     - To update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets.
     - They work on objects created literal or constructor notation.
     - To delete a property, use the delete keyword.

    This (It is a Keyword)
     - The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.
     - Where the function is declated alters what this means.
     - It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.

    Recap: Storing Data
     - In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
     - To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values.
     - In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

    Arrays are Objects
     - Arrays are actually a special type of object.
     - They hold a related set of key/value pairs (like all objects), but the key for each value is its index number.
   
    Arrays of Objects and Objects in Arrays
     - You can combine arrays and objects to creat complex data structures: Arrays can store a series of objects (and remember their order).
     - Objects can also hold arrays (as values of their properties).
