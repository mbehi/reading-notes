# Text Editor Notes

## Text Editor
What features should you look for in a text editor? 
1. Code Completion
1. Syntax Highlighting
1. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye stain and fatigue). 
1. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extension available when you need them.

## Basic Navigation
- What's in our current location? ls
- Two types of paths: absolute and relative
  - Absolute path specify a locatoin (file or directory) in relation to the root directory.
  - Relative path specify a locatoin (fiel or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system.
- Let's Move Around a Bit: cd [location]
- Summary
  - pwd: print working directory
  - ls: list the contents of a directory
  - cd: change directories

## About Files
- Everything is a file
- Linux is an extensionless system
  - file [path]
- Linux is case sensitive
- Spaces in names
  - Quotes: example 'Holiday Photos'
  - Escape Characters: a backslash (\)
