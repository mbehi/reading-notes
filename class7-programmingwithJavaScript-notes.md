## How JavaScript makes Web Pages More Interactive

1. Access Content: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
1. Modify Content: You can use JavaScript to add element, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
1. Program Rules: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
1. React to Events: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occured.

## Examples of JavaScript in the Browser

- Slideshows
- Forms
- Reload Part of Page
- Filtering Data

## Writing a Script

1. Define the Goal: First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
1. Design the Script: To design a script you split the goal out into to a series of tasks that are going to be invovled in solivng this puzzle.
1. Code Each Step: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

## Designing a Script: Tasks

- Once you know the goal of your script, you can work the individual tasks needed to achieve it.

## Designing a Script: Steps

- Each individual task may be broken down into a sequence of steps. When you are ready to code the script, these steps can then be translated into individual lines of code.

## Expressions

- An expression evaluates into (result in) a single value. Broadly speaking there ar two types of expessions.
  - 1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
  - 2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

## Operators

- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

## Arithmetic Operator

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `/` Division
- `*` Multiplication
- `++` Increment
- `--` Decrement
- `%` Modulus

## String Operator

- There is just one string operator: the `+` symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

## What is a Function?

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
- Calling the Function: When you ask it to perform its task
- Parameters: Pieces of informatino passed to a function
- Return Value: When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer

## Declaring a Function

- To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.

## Calling a Function

- Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function.

## Declaring Functions That Need Information

- Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters. Inside the function, the parameters act like varables.

## Calling Functions That Need Information

- When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or as variables.
