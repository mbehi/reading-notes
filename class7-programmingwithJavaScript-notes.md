## How JavaScript makes Web Pages More Interactive

1. Access Content: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
1. Modify Content: You can use JavaScript to add element, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
1. Program Rules: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
1. React to Events: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occured.

## Examples of JavaScript in the Browser

- Slideshows
- Forms
- Reload Part of Page
- Filtering Data

## Writing a Script

1. Define the Goal: First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
1. Design the Script: To design a script you split the goal out into to a series of tasks that are going to be invovled in solivng this puzzle.
1. Code Each Step: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

## Designing a Script: Tasks

- Once you know the goal of your script, you can work the individual tasks needed to achieve it.

## Designing a Script: Steps

- Each individual task may be broken down into a sequence of steps. When you are ready to code the script, these steps can then be translated into individual lines of code.

## Expressions

- An expression evaluates into (result in) a single value. Broadly speaking there ar two types of expessions.
  - 1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
  - 2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
