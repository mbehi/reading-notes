## Summarized View from HTML & CSS: Chapter 10: Introducton CSS

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Summarized View from Chapter 11: Color

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
