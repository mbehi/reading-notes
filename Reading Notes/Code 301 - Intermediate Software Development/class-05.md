2. What is the 'single responsibility principle' and how does it apply to components?

   2. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
3. What does it means to build a 'static' version of your application?
   1. To build components that resue other components and pass data using props.
4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
6. How can you indentify where state needs to live?
