# Class 8: Operators and Loops

## New Vocabulary

- Loop
- While
- For
- Condition
- Increment
- Decrement

## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions

- `==` is equal to
- `!=` is not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `===` strict equal to
- `!==` strict not equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to

## Logical Operators

- `&&` logical and
- `||` logical or
- `!` logical not

## Loops

- For: If you need to run code a speicific number of times, use a for loop. (It is the most common loop.) In a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.
- While: If you do not know how many ties the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for a as long as the condition is true.
- Do While: The do... while loop is very similiar to the while loop, but has one key difference, it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

## Loop Counters

- Inititalization: Create a variables and set it to 0. This variable is commonly called i, and it acts as the counter.
- Condition: The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number.
- Update: Every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter.
