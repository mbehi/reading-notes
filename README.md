## **A _growth mindset_ is a key to success in life. In order to improve any situation, you will need a growth mindset. It is essential for any _personal and professional_ development in life.**

Three reminders of yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset: 
1. I will become a Software Development Engineer, soon. 
2. I need to always remind myself of the reason that I joined Code Fellows.
3. I will never give up!
